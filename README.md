## Reading plans (v8.1.1)

The six reading plans from v7 are available again. Start a plan, choose a reminder time, and enable the daily notification. Android may ask for notification permission (Android 13+) and exact alarm access (Android 12+). If exact alarms are not allowed, Android may deliver the reminder a little later than the selected time.

Version 8.1.1 also fixes a launch crash in optimized builds by preserving the field names required by generated protobuf messages.

Use **Read today's plan** to read all chapters assigned for the current day in one reader view. **Mark day complete** advances the plan from that view. Tapping an individual chapter in the schedule still opens that chapter in the regular reader.

## Download

[Download the latest APK from GitHub Releases](https://github.com/claviger-pc/gnt-reader-android/releases/latest).

The v8.1.1 APK is a minified release build with unused resources removed. It is signed with a local development certificate because this fork does not have a release keystore configured; it installs as a fresh app, but cannot update an installation signed by Google Play or another key.

## App size

The v8 rewrite bundles about 20 selectable Greek fonts; v7 bundled one. The packaged database also grew from 7,979,008 bytes to 15,794,176 bytes. These app assets account for much of the larger v8 package. The initial 41 MB APK from this checkout was an unshrunk debug build. The optimized v8.1.1 release APK is about 21 MB with R8 code shrinking and resource shrinking enabled.

The app is [available on the Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mattrobertson.greek.reader).
